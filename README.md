Detecting fake news using machine learning techniques would mean having an automatic detection system that looks at a piece of text (tweets, news articles, a WhatsApp message) and determine how likely it looks like a piece of false news. The system will be a machine learning model trained on a large enough dataset containing examples of real and false news from various sources and styles. Machine learning models performing binary classification can be trained on this training set. However, since machine learning models only look at numerical features, we must perform natural language processing on this text corpus (collection of text samples).

Natural language processing will perform data cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization using one of the many available techniques and convert sentences into a vector of numbers that machine learning models can interpret. Once this is done, we can train models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests and observe their results.
